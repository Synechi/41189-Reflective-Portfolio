## Week 1 - Complex Adaptive Systems and Complexity in Social Worlds

### What have I learnt this week?

This week we learnt the definition of systems as well as given an introduction into complex systems. 

During the workshop we covered the different aspects and characteristics of a system as well as the different types of system boundaries. After that we covered what it means for a system to be complex, the difference between complex and complicated, as well as two key characteristics of a complex system, emergence and self organisation.

Lastly we were then introduced to complex adaptive systems.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

The most important thing I learnt this week was the difference between complex and complicated. Prior I thought that they were very much closely related and didn't have much distinction between two. I know understand that in the context of systems they can be related but a complex system doesn't mean that it's complicated and vice versa. Understanding that complicated systems create predictable outcomes where each element is working towards a goal where as complex systems create less predictable outcomes which house many individual elements that are working based on their own decisions, is the most important take away from this workshop.

### What insights have I gained?

Gaining a better understanding into what defines a system was very interesting, as someone who's worked with a variety of different systems it was very useful to be given an actual definition of what a system is. Actually understanding how to reference particular parts within a system is going to provide a lot of value to me in the future. This diagram (Figure 1.A) was really informative.

*Figure 1.A*

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

Definitely the hardest thing for me to wrap my head around was the different system boundaries. Without any examples it was very hard for me to grasp even though it seems like such a simple concept looking back on it. The examples given in the tutorial were very handy and allowed me to understand the topic.

Coming from a software development background I think my greatest strength in this subject area will be my understanding of the interaction between system elements and systems as a whole.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

Emergence is a topic I've never come across before and I found it very interesting. It's also something I've never really thought about before either, so after learning it in the workshop I wanted to find more examples of emergence within systems. I found that there are so many natural emergent structures in nature that I've experienced, for example termite mounds, sand dunes and even crystals. This definitely helped me to fully grasp what emergence is, which I can see will be very helpful for this subject.

## Week 2 - Understanding Complex Adaptive Systems: Many Model Thinking

### What have I learnt this week?

This week we were given an introduction to models. This was a very interesting workshop for me as I was able to learn about how models can help us understand the world around us. Learning the seven uses of models was also very informative.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

Biases was something that I have never put too much thought into. I knew that bias existed in data but I didn't understand to what extent. This week helped me grasp actually how bias impacts how we view everything, learning about how many different types of bias there is and realising how little I actually think about bias. 

### What insights have I gained?

I think the most important thing for me this week was understanding the importance of models. I have dealt with mathematical modeling in my past so it was very interesting to see how modeling can be applied and how they are just abstractions of the world around us.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

My data analytics experience has definitely helped me grasp the concepts shown so far, for example,  the wisdom hierarchy is very similar to the concepts taught in data analytics. I think my weaknesses going forward will be applying models to less technical concepts as that is still fairly foreign to me but I am definitely focusing on improving this skill as this was a major goal of mine with this subject.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

I didn't encounter any challenges this week, the concepts interested me I was able to focus really well.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

I think I should start taking notes during the workshop, as I think it would be a useful tool to reflect back on when writing this journal.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

The wisdom of crowds was an interesting topic to learn about, the use of examples was extremely helpful. Using collective judgement is incredibly valuable for estimating but there needs to be a lack of bias for the estimation to be accurate.

## Week 3 - People

### What have I learnt this week?

This week we started to visit the supermarket of models. The models covered in this workshop were all revolved around how to model people. The following are the models we covered:

 - Rational Actor Models (Not the best model to rely on but still a useful tool)
 - Behavioural Models
 - Rule-Based Models
 - Decision Models
 - Signalling Models
 - Cooperative Games Models

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

The different approaches taken to modeling people. The three models taught, rational, behavioural and rule-based all take different routes into consideration when modeling people. Rational assuming people will optimise and improve base on their goals, behavioural trying to model based on how people actually act and rule-based using psychology to create rules that fit our actions. Each different approach on their own can produce inaccuracies but combined they provide extremely useful insight.

### What insights have I gained?

It was very interesting to learn about signalling. Understanding that we signal through expensive jewellery or even just wasting money in general just so we can portray that we are wealthy or even complete our university degrees signals that we have the ability to learn and/or even just have the socioeconomic ability to attend university.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

Unfortunately I had a conflicting engagement this week during the workshop time slot so I wasn't able to attend. Thankfully I was able to catch up by reading through the canvas module as well as doing my own research into anything I got confused about on the way.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

***Spend more time with the content!*** This has probably been my biggest downfall so far. Going forward I will definitely allocate more time of my week to this subject to ensure I don't fall behind.


## Week 4 - Representing Human-centred Complex Systems

### What have I learnt this week?

This week we covered three important topics in regards to how to represent human-centred complex systems. Firstly we learn about system dynamics and the flow of feedback loops, next was networks where we learnt about the structure, logic and functionality. Lastly we discussed agent-based models and how

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

The 6 degrees of separation is a cool experiment that demonstrates the power of networks and emergent properties. Emergence was hard for me to grasp in the beginning but this example in particular helped me comprehend it in a new light.

![enter image description here](https://media.giphy.com/media/RkDd7Qyh6yMpqbiPiL/giphy.gif)



### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

My strengths this week were very useful for understanding the content. I have a good understanding of DevOps which utilises feedback loops to improve workflows, so being able to take that knowledge as a foundation for learning about system dynamics was valuable. I have also completed data structures and algorithms at UTS which also helped a lot when learning about networks as I've had to research, create and traverse graph data structures. I think these two models in particular are my favourite so far.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

I think my biggest challenge this week was there was no content for agent based models on canvas for me to do reflection on. As this was the area in which I had the least experience this week I wanted to spend my allocated time ensuring I understood everything but unfortunately I couldn't find it on canvas as it was just coming up with a blank page, so I ended up doing my own research into the topic which was useful.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

Learning about agent-based models was interesting and should hopefully be useful to me as I'm currently also studying a AI course this semester. We won't be covering this until a couple weeks time so this brief introduction should provide me with a good foundation for when we cover in the subject.

## Week 5 - Aggregating Decisions and Behaviour

### What have I learnt this week?

This week we had a heavy focus on distributions during the workshop and then were given some self study to do with linear models. I also learnt about aggregation and how it's useful for understanding complex systems.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

Self-organised criticality is a new concept I learnt this week. I learnt about two particular examples being the sand-pile model and the forest fire model. Both display that systems can build up and hit a critical point in which their behaviour changes. For the sand-pile example the sand is dropped onto a table in a pile which will continue to build up until it hits the critical point to which if any sand is added it will cause an avalanche dumping the excess sand resetting back to its critical point. I really like the visual examples as it helps with understanding the concept so much easier.

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/ot3PHxs.jpg)

### What insights have I gained?

The content we have covered so far has been very useful for changing how I view the world around me. I've learnt a lot of theory topics while studying at UTS but this subject has really helped to show how these concepts can be applied real life scenarios.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

I have covered statistics as a part of previous subjects while studying so understanding distributions was straight forward, it was interesting to see the different examples used to explain the concepts though as they definitely did help me when it came to refreshing my knowledge.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

Even though I have studied statistics in the past, it was more than a year ago so the content wasn't fresh in my mind. After the workshop I wanted to give myself a refresher so I went back into my notes and used that as a study material. Also in my assignment group we discussed about who would like to be the team lead. As I had the most experience with GitHub and python we came to the conclusion that I would be the team lead.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

Taking more initiative with my assignment group, making sure everyone is thinking about the tasks ahead as well as what models and topic we want to cover.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

The power law portion of the workshop has been the most insightful part for me this week. It was a concept I already knew about but again the way it was presented was valuable by linking it to the real world by showing the many different examples of how power law distribution can be used to analyse real businesses.

## Week 6 - How Complex System Evolve in Time

### What have I learnt this week?

Markov processes is a new topic I have learnt this week. The Markov model tracks how entities transition between states and the likelihood that an entity will transition. This is important for modelling as it can be applied to very simple concepts such as whether or not a student is bored to a country deciding if they should go to war.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

That there is a model for riots, in particular how we look at thresholds. Granovetter's riot model covers a very simple concept but is a very powerful model that helps predict the successful of social movements.  The model shows that the variety of thresholds is just as important as the average threshold as the variety has more impact over the chaining between thresholds.

### What insights have I gained?

Random walks are a new concept I've learnt this week which have opened my eyes to the power of complex systems even more. Comparing the model to a real life example being the stock exchange is very useful in showing how many of the systems around us in our everyday life can be modeled.

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/drkqc2l.jpg)

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

This week I struggled with understanding the solow growth model at first. I didn't understand the purpose of the equation but after reading over it a couple times I was finally able to understand that it's purpose is to calculate output so it can be compared to previous stages of growth.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

The broadcast model is very useful to me as it helps model an area in which I thought was impossible or very difficult to do. The spread of information or misinformation is very important as it shapes the way people view the world so being able to model and track how this information spreads is interesting. 

## Week 7 - Complexity and Emergent Behaviour Part 1

### What have I learnt this week?

This week we covered three main topics:
 - Segregation and Peer Effects
 - Coordination and Culture
 - Social Learning

Social learning covers replicator dynamics which is a very interesting model which I will be applying to the group assignment. The purpose of the model is the track how individuals adopt successful traits from the population around them.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

How important and influencing culture is on our society. Culture can be broken down into a variety of characteristics that help define the differences between cultures. 

### What insights have I gained?

The emergence of culture is due to the result of many coordination games. Cultures are created based on the result of these games leading to a very large number of possible cultures. Through this I was able to understand how cultures differ,

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

The replicator equation was the hardest challenge for me this week. Since I want to apply the replicator dynamics model to my assignment it was imperative for me to understand how this equation worked. I was able to do some self study as there is a lot of online resources that cover the equation in lots of detail.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

The revisiting of the standing ovation model was very useful to me, as the first time round I didn't really understand it's purpose and how to use it. Now after covering the majority of models and having a better understanding of complex systems in general I have been able to comprehend this model. The standing ovation model is very interesting due to the fact it attempts to count for all the factors that could impact a standing ovation.

![standing ovation](https://i.imgur.com/vGufhTg.png)

## Week 8 - Complexity and Emergent Behaviour Part 2

### What have I learnt this week?

This week is the last week we covered models, after this week we will be working on our group assignments. In particular I found the colonel blotto game to be very interesting as it changed my view on how I look at different strategies. Looking for the best strategy may not put you in the most advantageous as you're not including what strategies your opponents are doing.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

How broken the US election system is! Just kidding, seeing how colonel blotto games can be applied to the complex systems in our everyday life is valuable. This really changed my view on how I approach different strategies.

### What insights have I gained?

The prisoners' dilemma is an interesting game theory game that covers how players cooperate.
![Prisoners' dilemma](https://i.imgur.com/tzgbs8J.jpg)
This game shows the value of cooperation as both prisoners are collectively better off with both remaining silent and cooperating compared to any other option. This is their best options even if individually they would be better off confessing.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

This week we submitted our draft report for feedback. I think my team did really well based on our constraints and I'm happy with our progress. We will need to work out how we plan on implementing our models with our topic but that will come in the next couple of weeks.


## Week 9 - Project Work

### What have I learnt this week?

This week I researched into game theory as the model I'm covering in the final project in replicator dynamics. The replicator equation is used for evolutionary game theory to model how species adopt different traits. Game theory covers how competing players interact and strategise with each other via mathematical modeling. Game theory can be applied to real world scenarios to provide strategic advantage against other competitors.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

How powerful graphing can be using python. This week I also did some basic research into how I want to implement the model into jupyter notebooks. Using a library such as Matplotlib I will be able to plot and visualise the model.
![Matplotlib Example](https://i.imgur.com/xM9PHwW.png)

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

My strengths is my competency with GitHub and jupyter notebooks as well as my knowledge in python. I struggled a lot with trying to wrap my head around to more complicated game theory topic.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

The biggest challenge so far has been teaching my team how to properly use GitHub and jupyter notebooks. My entire team is new to both platforms so during our weekly meeting I was able to share my screen and teach them how to utilise GitHub and jupyter notebooks more effectively.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

Communicate with my team more. I think communication within our team needs to be improved as I believe we have issues with miscomunication. Going forward I will be hosting weekly stand ups/meetings to help accommodate for better communication as well as being active more in our communication channels.

## Week 10 - Project Work

### What have I learnt this week?

No progress was made this week due to other assignments taking priority.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

Unfortunately other assignments and studying took priority this week so I was unable to make any progress on the project.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

Better time management would be beneficial to help spread the workload around so I could have time to work on the project.


## Week 11 - Project Work

### What have I learnt this week?

This week I wanted to focus on learning how the replicator equation works. The equation is broken up into four sections, the growth rate, the frequency of a strategy, the fitness of a player following the strategy and lastly the average fitness for the population. 
![replicator equation](https://i.imgur.com/GWWekqz.png)


### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

My experience with programming has benefited me when it comes to implementing the model as I understand all the core concepts needed to utilise the different libraries needed.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

This week during our meeting we discussed how we plan on implementing our models with our topic. For most of us in the group modeling is new to us so trying to implement it into jupyter notebooks was a challenge. Luckily I found a good resource online to helped me with examples which I shared with my group.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

Work on the project more and assist my team members. This will reduce the workload and stress closer to the due date and also help my team members complete their sections of the project.

## Week 12 - Conclusions

### Conclusions

This subject was very interesting from a technical persons point of view. We covered a lot of topics that were not technical but the models used can be just as easily implemented into technical areas which I found very intriguing. Knowing how to model complex systems will be a very important skill in my future career as technology progresses. Thank you for the opportunity to learn this content as it has changed how I look at everything.
