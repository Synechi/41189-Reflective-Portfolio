## Week 1

### What have I learnt this week?

This week we learnt the definition of systems as well as given an introduction into complex systems. 

During the workshop we covered the different aspects and characteristics of a system as well as the different types of system boundaries. After that we covered what it means for a system to be complex, the difference between complex and complicated, as well as two key characteristics of a complex system, emergence and self organisation.

Lastly we were then introduced to complex adaptive systems.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

The most important thing I learnt this week was the difference between complex and complicated. Prior I thought that they were very much closely related and didn't have much distinction between two. I know understand that in the context of systems they can be related but a complex system doesn't mean that it's complicated and vice versa. Understanding that complicated systems create predictable outcomes where each element is working towards a goal where as complex systems create less predictable outcomes which house many individual elements that are working based on their own decisions, is the most important take away from this workshop.

### What insights have I gained?

Gaining a better understanding into what defines a system was very interesting, as someone who's worked with a variety of different systems it was very useful to be given an actual definition of what a system is. Actually understanding how to reference particular parts within a system is going to provide a lot of value to me in the future. This diagram (Figure 1.A) was really informative.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

Definitely the hardest thing for me to wrap my head around was the different system boundaries. Without any examples it was very hard for me to grasp even though it seems like such a simple concept looking back on it. The examples given in the tutorial were very handy and allowed me to understand the topic.

Coming from a software development background I think my greatest strength in this subject area will be my understanding of the interaction between system elements and systems as a whole.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

Emergence is a topic I've never come across before and I found it very interesting. It's also something I've never really thought about before either, so after learning it in the workshop I wanted to find more examples of emergence within systems. I found that there are so many natural emergent structures in nature that I've experienced, for example termite mounds, sand dunes and even crystals. This definitely helped me to fully grasp what emergence is, which I can see will be very helpful for this subject.
