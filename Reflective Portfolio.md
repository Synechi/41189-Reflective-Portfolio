## Week 1 - Complex Adaptive Systems and Complexity in Social Worlds

### What have I learnt this week?

This week we learnt the definition of systems as well as given an introduction into complex systems. 

During the workshop we covered the different aspects and characteristics of a system as well as the different types of system boundaries. After that we covered what it means for a system to be complex, the difference between complex and complicated, as well as two key characteristics of a complex system, emergence and self organisation.

Lastly we were then introduced to complex adaptive systems.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

The most important thing I learnt this week was the difference between complex and complicated. Prior I thought that they were very much closely related and didn't have much distinction between two. I know understand that in the context of systems they can be related but a complex system doesn't mean that it's complicated and vice versa. Understanding that complicated systems create predictable outcomes where each element is working towards a goal where as complex systems create less predictable outcomes which house many individual elements that are working based on their own decisions, is the most important take away from this workshop.

### What insights have I gained?

Gaining a better understanding into what defines a system was very interesting, as someone who's worked with a variety of different systems it was very useful to be given an actual definition of what a system is. Actually understanding how to reference particular parts within a system is going to provide a lot of value to me in the future. This diagram (Figure 1.A) was really informative.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

Definitely the hardest thing for me to wrap my head around was the different system boundaries. Without any examples it was very hard for me to grasp even though it seems like such a simple concept looking back on it. The examples given in the tutorial were very handy and allowed me to understand the topic.

Coming from a software development background I think my greatest strength in this subject area will be my understanding of the interaction between system elements and systems as a whole.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

Emergence is a topic I've never come across before and I found it very interesting. It's also something I've never really thought about before either, so after learning it in the workshop I wanted to find more examples of emergence within systems. I found that there are so many natural emergent structures in nature that I've experienced, for example termite mounds, sand dunes and even crystals. This definitely helped me to fully grasp what emergence is, which I can see will be very helpful for this subject.

## Week 2 - Understanding Complex Adaptive Systems: Many Model Thinking

### What have I learnt this week?

This week we were given an introduction to models. This was a very interesting workshop for me as I was able to learn about how models can help us understand the world around us. Learning the seven uses of models was also very informative.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

Biases was something that I have never put too much thought into. I knew that bias existed in data but I didn't understand to what extent. This week helped me grasp actually how bias impacts how we view everything, learning about how many different types of bias there is and realising how little I actually think about bias. 

### What insights have I gained?

I think the most important thing for me this week was understanding the importance of models. I have dealt with mathematical modeling in my past so it was very interesting to see how modeling can be applied and how they are just abstractions of the world around us.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

My data analytics experience has definitely helped me grasp the concepts shown so far, for example,  the wisdom hierarchy is very similar to the concepts taught in data analytics. I think my weaknesses going forward will be applying models to less technical concepts as that is still fairly foreign to me but I am definitely focusing on improving this skill as this was a major goal of mine with this subject.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

I didn't encounter any challenges this week, the concepts interested me I was able to focus really well.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

I think I should start taking notes during the workshop, as I think it would be a useful tool to reflect back on when writing this journal.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

The wisdom of crowds was an interesting topic to learn about, the use of examples was extremely helpful. Using collective judgement is incredibly valuable for estimating but there needs to be a lack of bias for the estimation to be accurate.

## Week 3 - People

### What have I learnt this week?

This week we started to visit the supermarket of models. The models covered in this workshop were all revolved around how to model people. The following are the models we covered:

 - Rational Actor Models (Not the best model to rely on but still a useful tool)
 - Behavioural Models
 - Rule-Based Models
 - Decision Models
 - Signalling Models
 - Cooperative Games Models

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

The different approaches taken to modeling people. The three models taught, rational, behavioural and rule-based all take different routes into consideration when modeling people. Rational assuming people will optimise and improve base on their goals, behavioural trying to model based on how people actually act and rule-based using psychology to create rules that fit our actions. Each different approach on their own can produce inaccuracies but combined they provide extremely useful insight.

### What insights have I gained?

It was very interesting to learn about signalling. Understanding that we signal through expensive jewellery or even just wasting money in general just so we can portray that we are wealthy or even complete our university degrees signals that we have the ability to learn and/or even just have the socioeconomic ability to attend university.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

Unfortunately I had a conflicting engagement this week during the workshop time slot so I wasn't able to attend. Thankfully I was able to catch up by reading through the canvas module as well as doing my own research into anything I got confused about on the way.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

***Spend more time with the content!*** This has probably been my biggest downfall so far. Going forward I will definitely allocate more time of my week to this subject to ensure I don't fall behind.


## Week 4 - Representing Human-centred Complex Systems

### What have I learnt this week?

This week we covered three important topics in regards to how to represent human-centred complex systems. Firstly we learn about system dynamics and the flow of feedback loops, next was networks where we learnt about the structure, logic and functionality. Lastly we discussed agent-based models and how

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

The 6 degrees of separation is a cool experiment that demonstrates the power of networks and emergent properties. Emergence was hard for me to grasp in the beginning but this example in particular helped me comprehend it in a new light.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

My strengths this week were very useful for understanding the content. I have a good understanding of DevOps which utilises feedback loops to improve workflows, so being able to take that knowledge as a foundation for learning about system dynamics was valuable. I have also completed data structures and algorithms at UTS which also helped a lot when learning about networks as I've had to research, create and traverse graph data structures. I think these two models in particular are my favourite so far.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

I think my biggest challenge this week was there was no content for agent based models on canvas for me to do reflection on. As this was the area in which I had the least experience this week I wanted to spend my allocated time ensuring I understood everything but unfortunately I couldn't find it on canvas as it was just coming up with a blank page, so I ended up doing my own research into the topic which was useful.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

Learning about agent-based models was interesting and should hopefully be useful to me as I'm currently also studying a AI course this semester. We won't be covering this until a couple weeks time so this brief introduction should provide me with a good foundation for when we cover in the subject.

## Week 5 - Aggregating Decisions and Behaviour

### What have I learnt this week?

This week we had a heavy focus on distributions during the workshop and then were given some self study to do with linear models. I also learnt about aggregation and how it's useful for understanding complex systems.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

Self-organised criticality is a new concept I learnt this week. I learnt about two particular examples being the sand-pile model and the forest fire model. Both display that systems can build up and hit a critical point in which their behaviour changes. For the sand-pile example the sand is dropped onto a table in a pile which will continue to build up until it hits the critical point to which if any sand is added it will cause an avalanche dumping the excess sand resetting back to its critical point. I really like the visual examples as it helps with understanding the concept so much easier.

### What insights have I gained?

The content we have covered so far has been very useful for changing how I view the world around me. I've learnt a lot of theory topics while studying at UTS but this subject has really helped to show how these concepts can be applied real life scenarios.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

I have covered statistics as a part of previous subjects while studying so understanding distributions was straight forward, it was interesting to see the different examples used to explain the concepts though as they definitely did help me when it came to refreshing my knowledge.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

Even though I have studied statistics in the past, it was more than a year ago so the content wasn't fresh in my mind. After the workshop I wanted to give myself a refresher so I went back into my notes and used that as a study material. Also in my assignment group we discussed about who would like to be the team lead. As I had the most experience with GitHub and python we came to the conclusion that I would be the team lead.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

Taking more initiative with my assignment group, making sure everyone is thinking about the tasks ahead as well as what models and topic we want to cover.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

The power law portion of the workshop has been the most insightful part for me this week. It was a concept I already knew about but again the way it was presented was valuable by linking it to the real world by showing the many different examples of how power law distribution can be used to analyse real businesses.
